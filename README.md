>I will just say it now. The *universe is scary*, and it's even scarier to think if we are alone in the universe. Why is it scary to think so? If we really are alone. That means that the only complex organism that lives is us, and that leaves 
us the responsibility of staying alive or else the universe's only life form will die. Leaving the universe to have no more living organisms. Although I doubt that we really are the only living creatures in this wide, and vast universe.
Scientists and astronomers have been able to observe 46.1 billion light years, and thats only the observable part of our universe. There is much more out there, and I'm sure at least one of those planets holds life. In addition to that, 
the observable universe that astronomers are able to observe is 46.1 billion light years, which means what we are seeing now is what well see 46.1 billion years into the past. 46 billion years is a lot so I'm sure in that amount of time
there has been change in those areas of the universe. 
- A light year is how much distance you can travel at the speed of light in one year.
- The universe is 13 billion years old
